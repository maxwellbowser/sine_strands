# sine_strands 
### Description:
Python/MATLAB Analysis pipeline for Sinusoidal Perturbation.  
Extracts elastic moduli, viscus moduli, and individual components of complex moduli (A, k, B, C, and rates) from sinusoidal perturbation data.

### Installation:
**Python Files**  
For compiled version, download the zip file containing all files, then then create a shortcut on your desktop which launches the sine_strands application (.exe).
It is important that the application file DOES NOT leave the folder, because otherwise it won't know where to find the software files.

For running Python files, ensure that all used libraries are installed and then run the script using VScode or other Python interface.  

**MATLAB Files**  
This MATLAB software is only tested on version R2023b, so ensure that MATLAB R2023b is installed.
MATLAB files are included in a folder, which has all of the needed MATLAB files included, as well as an output folder. Download this folder
